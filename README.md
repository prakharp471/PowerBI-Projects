**Power BI Projects Portfolio**

Welcome to my Power BI Projects repository! This collection features interactive dashboards built to explore real-world datasets and uncover actionable insights across business domains like sales, workforce analytics, and tech industry trends. Each folder contains a zipped Power BI `.pbix` file, sample data, and a dedicated project README that explains the problem statement, visual design choices, key metrics, and insights derived from the analysis.
Whether you're a recruiter, data enthusiast, or fellow analyst, feel free to explore the dashboards and see how data storytelling, DAX, and design come together to drive informed decision-making.
